# Hypackel Lite

Welcome to Multiplire-X5! Due to the Github Pages 3GB limit, I won't be adding any games anytime soon.

> **Note**
> **If you do fork this repo, please give the orginal repo a star! It helps out a lot and only 30% of people who fork give me a star.**

## Deployment

If Multiplire-X5 or Hypackel Lite is blocked but .github.io domains are unblocked you can make your own copy:

1. Scroll up and click fork
2. click settings and rename the the repository to `YOURUSERNAME.github.io`. Replace your username with your actual github username
3. click pages and change it to deploy from a branch
4. it should give you a url in a few minutes. if not then go to the actions tab and if workflows are not enabled, click to enable them
